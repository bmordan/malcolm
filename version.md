This article explains why the harbour site at Salamis is important to us today and provides new  evidence of the structure and location of the remains of the ship–sheds that Evagoras built at his  naval harbour at |Salamis for his fleet of triremes.   It establishes the position of the northeast corner of the city wall which separated harbour from city, supported by a forgotten 18th century map of the ancient city of Salamis.

Key words. Salamis Cyprus, Evagoras, trireme, ship-shed, Classical harbour.

         The naval harbour that King Evagoras had built c. 410-400 B.C. to house his fleet of triremes at Salamis, for which we have historical evidence, is important to us today for two main reasons.
        Firstly, it is important historically because its construction provides a vivid illustration of the three-cornered power struggle that was taking place in the Mediterranean between Athens, Sparta and the Persian empire at the end of the fifth century .
Evagoras, whose ambition it was to unify Cyprus under his command, cultivated the friendship of the Athenians. (According to the mythology of the time, Evagoras could claim ancestry from King Telemon of Salamis Island who, it was said, fought alongside Ajax at Troy and was the legendary founder of the city of Salamis).                                                                           When the Athenians were defeated by the Peloponnesian fleet at Aegospotami, it was with Evagoras at Salamis that the Athenian general Conon and his remaining fleet took refuge in 405 B.C. Later, Evagoras took part in the battle of Cnidus in 394 B.C. and provided most of the resources with which the Spartan fleet were defeated. In recognition of Evagoras’ services, the Athenians raised a statue to him and he was made an honorary citizen of Athens.
By 391 B.C. Evagoras was virtually at war with the Persians, whose strategy was to keep Cyprus divided into city states and he remained a thorn in their side until they invaded Cyprus in 385 B.C. A peace was then concluded, which allowed Evagoras to remain king of Salamis until his death in 374 B.C.
It was the possession of a formidable fleet of triremes at his naval harbour at Salamis that allowed Evagoras to play such a dominant role in the Eastern Mediterranean and to keep the Persians at bay for 15 years.
     The second reason why Salamis harbour is important to us today, lies in its quality as an archaeological site. Evagoras’ naval harbour  has been abandoned for over two thousand years and has been spared the kind of modern redevelopment, that has occurred at Piraeus.                      Salamis also has an added advantage as an archaeological site. The catastrophic earthquake of the fourth century A.D. effectively raised the sea level at Salamis by about two metres with the result that the ancient shoreline has now become a reef, about a hundred metres offshore. The result of this is that the naval harbour is presently sited in the calm waters of a lagoon and has been largely protected from winter storms for the last eighteen hundred years.
Recent survey work carried out at Salamis harbour.
         In the early 1970’s, prior to the Turkish occupation of North Cyprus in 1974, both N.C.Fletcher and A Raban carried out survey work in the southern half of the harbour. (Fletcher,1974 and Raban,1993) Their work was confined to the southern half of the harbour, taking in the old commercial port south of the headland and the area immediately  north of the headland.                                                                                                                                    After the occupation in 1974, the U.N. issued a mandate that no archaeological work should be carried out in North Cyprus without U.N. approval. At that point in time, there was no information about the site of Evagoras’ naval harbour, built for his fleet of triremes.
In 2012 the writer published an article, based on observations and research alone, that suggested that the site of Evagoras’ ship-sheds might lie at the northern extremity of the harbour at Salamis, about 700 metres north of the headland. The evidence for this was very limited and consisted of a report by Tubbs, a 19th century English archaeologist, that he had observed ‘remains of quays?’ at the north point, a single standing ashlar pillar, situated north of the point and a few pieces of roof tile on the beach at the north point. ( Davies, 2012)
Recent evidence of ship sheds around the north point.
 a. Photographs taken at the north point in 2013.
           In 2013 I received some photographs, which had been taken taken at the north point by the local Salamis site guide, after winter storms and at low tide, which clearly show lines of cut ashlar stones projecting into the lagoon at right angles to the shoreline. It was at this north point that Tubbs recorded “remains of quays?” on his map of Salamis.

Three photographs taken at the North point in 2013.                                                                   (Courtesy of  S.Kanay)

More evidence of the ship-sheds at the north point, looking South towards the headland, about 600 metres away,( just visible at top right hand corner), taken from the same position as photo 1. The ancient shoreline is clearly visible at the top left and centre of the photograph.. Inside the reef are constructed stone features, which may mark the line of the outer defensive wall of the harbour.



Photo 3.
Taken at the north point, looking East towards the old shoreline. The ashlar stone construction dips below the flat surface of the lagoon, indicating  the stones were laid on a gradient.

There can be little doubt that the structures captured in these three photographs are the very same features that Tubbs observed in the 1890’s. It is also clear  that the structures have the characteristics of the foundations of ancient ship-sheds.
b. Observed  evidence of ship-sheds near the north point.                                                                          I revisited Salamis in Sept.2015 but sand had re-covered  the features, which Kanay had photographed at the north point in 2013.  However, for about 120 metres further north of the point, there was evidence along the shoreline of both rectangular, cut ashlar stones and nine circular pillars, which were similar to the pillar/roof supports which were featured in the famous photograph below, taken at the excavated ship-sheds  at the ancient harbour at Zea in 1891. (Blackman and Rankov, 2014)
Photo 4.



The pillars at Salamis were all about a metre in length and all but one of the pillars had been displaced.  The exception was the single, standing pillar, which was recorded in 2010 and which was still in situ, about 90 metres to the north of the point.
Because of the high degree of protection from the open sea that the present shoreline is given by the old shoreline, it was concluded that these pillars were unlikely to have moved very far and offered evidence of the position and extent of the ship-sheds, that were sited in the north of the harbour.(Photos 5. and 6. ).

                                                              Photo 5.



A group of six displaced pillars lying north of the point. They appear to be roughly in the position where they had fallen.











Photo 6.
   The one remaining in situ base pillar, which would have supported the ship-shed roof, still stands after two and a half thousand years.

There was no visible evidence of cut ashlar stones or pillars further north of this area.
         To the south of the north point, there was intermittent evidence of cut ashlar stones and one  pillar, marked  in fig 1. A quantity of tile was visible in the shallow waters adjacent to this pillar.
Further south of this pillar there was no further evidence of ship shed remains.
The evidence indicates that the ship-sheds for Evagoras’ fleet of triremes extended from  north of the campanopetra basilica, visible on fig 1., to a point about 120 metres north of the point, a distance of about 230 metres. A theoretical calculation, allowing about 6 metres per ship shed, suggests that this would give enough capacity for about 38 trireme ship sheds.
The position of all  ten observed pillars is shown below.

 Evidence of the ancient city wall at the north end of the naval harbour.
     Remains of the ancient city wall of Salamis, which divided the naval harbour from the city of Salamis were observed and noted in the sandbank at the back of the beach at the north end of the harbour in 2010. (Fig 1.) By 2015 it had become more evident that these cut ashlar stones were laid down lengthwise in a N/S direction, parallel with the shoreline.

Massive cut ashlar stones  at the back of the beach at the northern end of the harbour, photographed in 2015 and interpreted as the foundation stones of the eastern city wall, which divided the city from the harbour.
A  few metres to the north of this area was what appeared to be the northeast corner of the city wall. (Photo 8.)There was no visible evidence of any further stone work further north of this point. It is likely that this remnant of the north wall of the city continued eastwards towards a large, underwater area of natural rock and formed the northern defensive wall of the naval harbour.

An early record of the city walls at Salamis.
         Richard Pococke, a bishop of the Church of Ireland, but better known for his travel writings, visited Salamis some time between 1737 and 1741 and recorded his findings  in 1745. (Pococke, 1745)
He wrote, “There are still large heaps of ruins on the spot of the ancient city (Salamis) and great remains of the foundations of the walls, which seem to have been between 3 and 4 miles in circumference”.  Pococke attached a plan of the city, showing the ancient city wall boundaries and the walls of a smaller city within, which he describes as ‘later’.
This smaller city has the characteristic layout of a Roman town and was serviced by an aqueduct, noted by Pococke.



      Figure 2                                                                       Pococke’s notes.

Pococke’s sketch of Salamis, although lacking a scale, gives us a picture of the large size and location of  Evagoras’ city and shows the line of the eastern city wall that divided the city from the naval harbour. He also shows where the south wall of the city ran parallel to the river, a feature, which was later identified by Raban.  (Raban 1995)
 It also seems very probable, that the feature, identified above (photo 8.) as the northeast corner of the city wall, coincides with the position of this same feature shown on Pococke’s map.
      It is worth noting that the description and plan of Salamis, which Pococke put to paper in 1745, gives us a unique view of the ancient city before the stone-robbing that must have taken place subsequently, along with the natural sand cover that has accumulated  over the site since that time. Pococke’s notes and map appear to have passed unnoticed by the British and French archaeologists of the 19th and 20th century who worked on the city site.                               The map, which was clearly made when the remains of the city of Salamis were much more visible, offers a very useful framework for any future archaeological exploration of the city, when political accord returns to Cyprus. It is hoped that the observed evidence for the siting of Evagoras’ ship sheds, which is contained in this article, will also be useful when it becomes possible to carry out a thorough survey of the northern half of the harbour.
